================================================================================\nINTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS\n================================================================================\n\n1. PEAK FLOW ALTERATION (Indicator a):\n------------------------------------------------------------\n   • On average, reservoirs REDUCE peak flows by 29.9%\n   • This demonstrates flood control function\n   • Peaks are attenuated by storing water during high flow events\n   • FOL: -28.7% change\n   • NML: -10.4% change\n   • DNP: -12.5% change\n   • PNF: -14.9% change\n   • CLE: -24.8% change\n   • SHA: -36.1% change\n   • EXC: -46.5% change\n   • ORO: -26.3% change\n   • BER: -68.7% change\n\n2. LOW FLOW ALTERATION (Indicator b):\n------------------------------------------------------------\n   • On average, reservoirs AUGMENT low flows by 320.1%\n   • Stored water is released during dry periods\n   • This benefits downstream ecosystems and water supply\n   • FOL: 61.8% change\n   • NML: -47.8% change\n   • DNP: -10.7% change\n   • PNF: -67.3% change\n   • CLE: 2228.1% change\n   • SHA: -2.9% change\n   • EXC: 330.6% change\n   • ORO: 0.8% change\n   • BER: 388.5% change\n\n3. FLASHINESS - Richards-Baker Index (Indicator e):\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   HOW FLASHINESS IS CALCULATED:\n   • Formula: RBI = Σ|Qᵢ - Qᵢ₋₁| / ΣQᵢ\n   • Numerator: Sum of absolute day-to-day flow changes\n   • Denominator: Total flow volume (normalization)\n   • Steps:\n     1. For each day, calculate: change = |today's flow - yesterday's flow|\n     2. Sum all daily changes\n     3. Divide by sum of all daily flows\n\n   WHAT THIS INDEX CAPTURES:\n   • Frequency of flow changes (how often flow varies)\n   • Magnitude of flow changes (how much flow varies)\n   • Flow stability:\n     - Low RBI (0.05-0.10) = Stable, regulated flows\n     - High RBI (0.30-0.50) = Flashy, rapidly changing flows\n   • Dimensionless → allows comparison between different sized streams\n\n   RESULTS:\n   • Average RBI reduction: 0.1954\n   • Reservoirs REDUCE flashiness (stabilize flows)\n   • This is typical: storage dampens natural variability\n   • Benefits: More predictable habitat conditions\n\n   • FOL: -0.1104 change\n   • NML: 0.0115 change\n   • DNP: -0.2210 change\n   • PNF: -0.0938 change\n   • CLE: -0.1363 change\n   • SHA: -0.1331 change\n   • EXC: -0.0918 change\n   • ORO: -0.1120 change\n   • BER: -0.8714 change\n\n\n4. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESERVOIR CAPACITY AND ALTERATION:\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   GENERAL PRINCIPLES:\n   • Larger reservoirs have greater storage capacity\n   • Greater capacity = greater ability to modify flows\n   • Expected patterns:\n     - Large reservoirs: Strong peak reduction, high low flow augmentation\n     - Small reservoirs: Minimal alterations, flows similar to natural\n\n   OBSERVATIONS FROM CURRENT DATA:\n   • Most peak reduction: BER (-68.7%)\n   • Least peak reduction: NML (-10.4%)\n\n   To properly assess capacity-alteration relationships, we would need:\n   • Reservoir storage capacity (acre-feet or m³)\n   • Storage capacity to mean annual flow ratio\n   • Then perform correlation analysis\n\n\n5. ECOLOGICAL AND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS:\n------------------------------------------------------------\n   • Flow regime is a 'master variable' for river ecosystems\n   • Peak flow reductions:\n     - Reduce flooding risk (positive for humans)\n     - May prevent channel-forming flows (negative for habitat)\n     - Can reduce floodplain connectivity\n   • Low flow augmentation:\n     - Maintains minimum flows for aquatic life\n     - Prevents thermal stress and low dissolved oxygen\n     - Supports fish passage and migration\n   • Timing shifts:\n     - Affect spawning cues and migration timing\n     - May desynchronize ecological relationships\n   • Flashiness changes:\n     - Reduced flashiness stabilizes benthic communities\n     - But may reduce natural flow variability that species need\n\n================================================================================
